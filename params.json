The build to be modified is designated by passing in the Build Number (not the Build\r\nID). The Build Number is mapped to the Build ID internally and the retention is set accordingly.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nThere are multiple command-line arguments for calling VSTS-Keep, including:\r\n\r\n|Name     |Required|Comments                                                                        |\r\n|---------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n|-a       |Yes     |Specifies the VSTS account to use.                                              |\r\n|-t       |Yes     |Specifies the name of the VSTS team project containing the build to be modified.|\r\n|-u       |No      |Specifies the User ID used to sign into VSTS (optional if using a PAT).         |\r\n|-p       |Yes     |Specifies the password or Personal Access Token (PAT) used to sign into VSTS.   |\r\n|-b       |Yes     |Specifies the build number to set retention on/off for.                         |\r\n|-k       |No      |Set to 1 to keep build forever; else, set to 0. Default = 0.                    |\r\n|-v       |No      |If specified, turns on verbose output.                                          |\r\n\r\n**Examples**\r\n\r\nSet retention to \"Keep Forever\" while authenticating with Alternate (Basic) Credentals:\r\n\r\n    VSTS-Keep -a MyAccount -t MyProject -u someone@hotmail.com -p MyS3cr3tP@ssw0rd -b 20160303.1 -k 1\r\n\r\nSet retention to \"Keep Forever\" while authenticating with a Personal Access Token (PAT):\r\n\r\n    VSTS-Keep -a MyAccount -t MyProject -p aq4atoiecgzpt7gtw54dlzfja7vlr3hbkm2kl2pkjmr32obr5juq -b 20160303.1 -k 1\r\n\r\nRemove retention while authenticating with a Personal Access Token (PAT):\r\n\r\n    VSTS-Keep -a MyAccount -t MyProject -p aq4atoiecgzpt7gtw54dlzfja7vlr3hbkm2kl2pkjmr32obr5juq -b 20160303.1\r\n\r\n## VSTS-Get\r\nAllows you to download a single file or an entire folder from a Git-based repo in VSTS without the need for a Git client.\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: TFVC-based repositories are not yet supported by these tools.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
